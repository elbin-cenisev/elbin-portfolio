# My Portfolio Website
Homework Assignment: Create a portfolio website.
Author: Elbin Cenisev

## General Notes
Right now, this site is not professional and not much of a portfolio, but I hope it will serve as a basic skeleton for future updates.

## Problems / Future fixes
As it stands, I had to use a lot of patchwork fixes to get this to look the way it does. The main problems I want to address are:

1. Overblown margins - 
Probably not an efficient solution for moving sections up and down the page.

2. Image Overlays - 
They look very primitive, there is no fade-in animation, the color scheme isn't good, etc.
It is important to note that the overlays are based on copy & pasted code that I do not fully follow. 
The original author is credited in overlay.css' note.

3. The terrible #work-list section - 
This contains image links to my individual Github repositories.
This section is an absolute mess, I am not proud of it, it needs to be rewritten.
I used nested flex-rows, and I don't think that's standard practice in the industry.
There must be a better way to do this.
Each image link also has its own awkward #id, and that's just to get the image overlays to work by the due date.

4. General Design - 
I went for black because that is the easiest to style for (and what many others used online for their portfolios).
I have to play with gradient colors, because black/purple doesn't work in my opinion.
